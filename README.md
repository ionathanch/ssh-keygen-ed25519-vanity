# ssh-keygen-ed25519-vanity

Finds a vanity EdDSA SSH public key (and corresponding private key, of course) by brute force.
Requires `libsodium` to be installed to generate the raw Ed25519 keypair.
Run `make` to compile to executable `vanity`,
then `./vanity <substring>` to find a public key with given substring.
There is also a shell script that does basically the same thing but by actually running `ssh-keygen`,
which is probably slower.

NEW: There is now an additional Rust version, which can be compiled with `cargo build`,
then run with `cargo run -- <substring> [keyfile]`.
The private key will be written to `[keyfile]`,
while the public key will be written to `[keyfile].pub`.
If no keyfile path is provided, the private key will be printed to stdout.

This is already covered by the licence, but once again I am **not** responsible for your use of this code.
Don't @ me.
(You can open an issue if there's any problems, with no guarantee that I'll look at it.)

## Handy commands

```sh
# Pipe public key to <file>.pub and private key to <file>,
# while displaying public key on stdout.
./vanity <substring> | tee >(head -n 1 > <file>.pub) >(tail -n 3 > <file>) | head -n 1
# Search for key in parallel, with 4 jobs
parallel -n 0 ./vanity <substring> -- 1 2 3 4
# Generate fingerprint and attempt to find the public keyfile.
ssh-keygen -lf <file>
# Generate public key from private keyfile.
ssh-keygen -yf <file>
```

## OpenSSH Ed25519 private key format

I don't know what the two 4-byte check values are for.
OpenSSH literally generates it just using `arc4random()`,
but doesn't do anything with it except duplicate it.
You can edit the source to use your favourite hex word; I'm using `0xf0cacc1a`.

The blocksize is [8](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/cipher.c#L110),
and for [some reason](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/sshkey.c#L3972) the number of padding bytes is total modulo 16.
Since up until just before the padding there are 229 bytes, there are 5 bytes of padding,
which OpenSSH conventionally pads with successive integral values.
This doesn't really make sense to me since 16 doesn't divide 234...

If you decide to add a comment you'll have to change both its declared length
as well as the declared length of the remaining bytes after the first public key,
both of which are currently hardcoded,
_and then_ also recalculate the needed amount of padding.

## Rough performance stats

Obviously since it's brute force the times are probabilistic,
but this gives you an idea of how feasible it would be to find your desired number of characters.

| Substring | Time (s) |
| --------- | -------- |
| a         | 0.002    |
| ar        | 0.015    |
| ars       | 0.501    |
| arso      | 3.753    |
| arson     | abandon all hope ye who seek five sequential characters |
